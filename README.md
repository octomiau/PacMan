### Project Title: 
Pac-Man exercise

### Description of Project
This code creates a simple Pac-Man game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game includes several functions, such as makePac, update, checkCollisions, stopAndFreezeAnimation, and startAnimation.

-The makePac function creates a new Pac-Man object with a randomly generated position, velocity, and image. 
-The update function is called repeatedly to update the position of each Pac-Man object and check for collisions with the boundaries of the article element. 
-The checkCollisions function handles the logic for changing the image and direction of each Pac-Man object when it collides with the article boundaries.
-The stopAndFreezeAnimation and startAnimation functions provide the ability to pause and resume the animation of the Pac-Man objects. 

### How to Run
Fork the repo or clone it to your local machine. 

### Roadmap of future improvements: 
In progress...
-Make the ghosts flicker as in the real game.
-Try to make every added ghost in a different color.
-Make the pacmans change images in order to see them open and close their mouth.
